### I've started working on SteamKM2 (Still very W.I.P) ###
A couple of cool features in the new app (which are already implemented):
- **Game Card Entries**: Brand new game card design for game entries which also support different layout options (**grid**, **list**).
- **Moar Keys**: A ton of new key formats are supported now: Steam, EA, Ubisoft etc... (doesn't even have to be game/platform specific key, write whatever you want in the key line).
- **Tags**: Add multiple tags (previously known as categories) to a single game entry, and later on use the tag filters section on the home page to easily find games that match your selected tags.
- **Page System**: Brand new page logic, instead of opening gazillion dialog windows, you can now navigate pages with the new page selector bar. Pages are also preserved, so if you were editing a theme and accidentally (or intentionally) clicked on another page, then you can always just reopen that page and continue where you left off.
- **Movable Page Selector Bar**: Move the page selector bar to the left, top, right, bottom (as in the picture) edge of the window. (I really need to come up with a better name for it other than "Page Selector Bar")
- **Custom Named Themes**: You can now have unlimited themes with custom names, you can even overwrite the built-in theme colors if you want to. No restrictions.
- **Animated Gradient Bar**: Color customizable central animated gradient bar. Doesn't do anything special, it just looks fancy.
